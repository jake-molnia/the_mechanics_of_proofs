# The Mechanics of Proofs

This is a solution to all the exercises and homework presented in the book [The Mechanics of a Proof](https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/index.html).

Just to remind you, this book is supplementary to __Math 2001__ taught at Fordham University. Therefore please respect _academic honesty_ when going through these.
Every solution is given with the intent to help someone when studying proofwriting in lean and not as a tool to cheat in class.

__This is a working progress and will be updated semi-frequently while I work through the book__

If you have any questions or better solutions please contact [me](jrmolnia@wpi.edu).
